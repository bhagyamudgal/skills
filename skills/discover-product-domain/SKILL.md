# Discover Product Domains

Turn a product idea into memorable names whose exact `.com` domains are
confirmed at a registrar. Treat human combinations such as `Vids` + `Jar` as a
core discovery mechanism, not an afterthought.

## Mode

Use **guided mode** by default. Extract known facts first, then ask one unresolved
high-impact question at a time with 2-4 options and the recommended choice first.
Use **rapid mode** only when the user explicitly asks for a quick, autonomous, or
single-pass result; apply the defaults below and skip the human remix turn.

Registrar and account interactions are read-only. Search and verify domains, but
stop before sign-in, cart, offer, purchase, registration, handle creation, or any
other external mutation. A local Markdown report is allowed only when requested.

## Entry route

Choose the shortest route that preserves work the user already supplied. This
table owns which steps a route runs; no later step re-decides it.

| Route | Steps | What the route starts from |
|---|---|---|
| **Greenfield** | 1-8 | an idea; run the full funnel |
| **Verification or ranking only** | 1, 4, 6-8 | a shortlist to score, screen, confirm, and rank. Never generates, remixes, or expands |
| **Shortlist plus alternatives** | 1, 2, 4-8 | a shortlist that is itself the human reaction; the step 2 atom bank comes from it and the brief |
| **Remix or refinement** | 1, 2, 5-8 | names, fragments, or one name as the human reaction, satisfying the guided-mode remix requirement; the atom bank comes from them and the brief |

Do not replace, silently expand, or ignore a supplied candidate set. Generate
beyond it only when the request asks for alternatives or the user approves
loosening an insufficient shortlist.

## Funnel

### 1. Lock the naming brief

Capture these fields from the conversation before asking anything:

- what is being named and its one-sentence job;
- primary audience and market language;
- core promise and desired emotional signal;
- three-year expansion boundary;
- desired and forbidden tones, words, sounds, and associations;
- whether the name should describe the product or work as an abstract mark;
- other languages the audience reads, the field whose jargon it speaks, and any
  existing brand this name must not collide with.

Default unresolved preferences to warm, clear, credible, globally pronounceable,
5-10 characters, 2 syllables where natural, and no hyphens or digits. Default the
describe-or-abstract field to no requirement to describe, and read
`references/naming-lenses.md` under **Description is optional** before generating.
When the audience's other languages, jargon field, or brand-collision targets go
unstated, default to the market language plus English, the audience's own field
as the jargon source, and every brand the user has named in this conversation;
record those defaults, because the **Wart check** in `naming-lenses.md` runs on
them. In guided mode, ask only when a different answer would materially change
the candidate set.

**Complete when:** every field is answered or carries an explicit default.

### 2. Build the atom bank

Read the **Atom bank** section of
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/naming-lenses.md`, then extract at least 12
distinct **atoms** across at least four of its semantic buckets. Mark each atom's
source and type so later remixes preserve their provenance.

**Complete when:** the atom bank has enough direct, suggestive, metaphorical,
emotional, and phonetic material for all three naming lenses.

### 3. Generate independently

Dispatch three naming agents in parallel when subagents are available. Read the
complete lens contracts in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/naming-lenses.md`:

1. **Compounder**
2. **Positioner**
3. **Phonetic inventor**

Give each agent the same brief and atom bank, but none of the other agents'
candidates. Embed that agent's complete lens rules and the required output shape
from `naming-lenses.md` in its task; do not assume a subagent can resolve this
skill's relative paths. Each returns its allocated share of a 36-name pool;
**Description is optional** in `references/naming-lenses.md` owns the split and
when it shifts. When subagents are unavailable, run the three lenses sequentially
and keep their pools separate until synthesis.

**Complete when:** 36 raw names exist, split across the three independent lenses
by the brief's allocation.

### 4. Synthesize or assess

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/domain-verification.md` before any lookup;
it owns the two-rung evidence ladder: **screen** with a registry lookup, then
**confirm** at a registrar, and the status vocabulary both rungs record.

Score every candidate with the **Brand score** table in
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/naming-lenses.md`. Domain availability is **the
domain gate**: the exact standard-price `.com`, confirmed at a registrar, and it
sits outside that score.

For a greenfield route, deduplicate the pool, apply the remix operators from
`naming-lenses.md`, and select 12 names spanning all three lenses. For a supplied
shortlist, preserve and score every supplied candidate without demanding 12 names
or artificial lens coverage. Preserve strong atoms from rejected names; a taken
compound can still contain half of the winner.

Screen the current candidate set's canonical `.com` domains and account for every
lookup with the status vocabulary.

In guided greenfield mode, present the first pass and collect the one structured
reaction defined in `naming-lenses.md`. In rapid mode, create an autonomous
reaction: retain the four strongest atoms or patterns, reject weaknesses shared by
the bottom candidates, and record that the human remix turn was intentionally
skipped and no user preference was inferred.

**Complete when:** a greenfield user supplied a remix reaction; rapid mode recorded
its autonomous reaction; a shortlist-with-alternatives preserved the supplied set
as its reaction; or a verification-only shortlist has a screened status for every
supplied name.

### 5. Produce eight remixes

A remix or refinement route reaches its first score and lookup here: read step 4's
two references before either.

Treat every user-created combination as a first-class seed. Apply the **Remix
operators** in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/naming-lenses.md`. Send the
reaction to the original lens owners as follow-up tasks when possible, embedding
the relevant remix operators and output contract in each task. Otherwise apply the
operators locally. Produce eight new names that cross favored atoms while avoiding
rejected patterns. Score the original supplied seeds and the eight remixes
together, then screen every canonical `.com` not already checked.

**Complete when:** eight non-cosmetic remixes have a recorded screened status.

### 6. Control expansion

A **provisional** name holds `candidate_available_rdap`: screened, not confirmed.
That permits registrar confirmation but does not prove the domain can be bought.

Use these transitions; do not wait in step 6 for evidence that only step 7 can
produce:

- **Invalid supplied spelling:** request the exact `.com` spelling and stop with
  **Input blocked** until the user resolves it. Record and exclude invalid generated
  candidates without treating them as evidence failures.
- **Unknown evidence:** retry once using the backoff in `domain-verification.md`.
  Keep a nonessential generated unknown recorded and exclude it when enough other
  candidates can still meet the domain gate. If an unknown belongs to a supplied
  shortlist or prevents the domain gate, stop with **Evidence blocked**, naming the
  affected domains and the evidence boundary that failed; do not spend naming
  rounds during an evidence outage.
- **Unconfirmed provisional names exist:** proceed to step 7.
- **Short of three finalists with no provisional left to confirm:** a route that
  does not generate returns its survivors to step 8. Otherwise, when fewer than two
  expansion rounds have run, dispatch the three lenses with failed roots, registrar
  rejection reasons, favored atoms, and length constraints. Embed each lens's
  complete rules and output contract as in step 3. Deduplicate and score the new
  pool, select its strongest new names, screen them, then apply these transitions
  again.
- **Two expansion rounds exhausted:** ask which naming constraint to loosen: atom
  vocabulary, tone, maximum length, or compound complexity. Do not weaken the domain
  gate. An answer resets the expansion counter once; a declined or fruitless
  loosening stops with **Generation shortfall**.

Keep each lens independent during generation.

### 7. Confirm at the registrar

Follow the confirm stage in
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/domain-verification.md` and record the evidence
fields it requires. On a generating route, confirm provisional names until three
clear the domain gate; on a verification-only shortlist, confirm every provisional
supplied name.

Exclude premium, aftermarket, reserved, taken, and unknown domains from the final
three. Recheck a chosen name immediately before the user acts because availability
is never reserved by a search.

If fewer than three finalists survive and the active route generates, return to
step 6. For a verification-only supplied shortlist, report the shortfall without
inventing replacements.

**Complete when:** a generation route has three registrar-confirmed finalists or a
step 6 **Generation shortfall**; or every supplied domain in a verification-only
shortlist has a terminal status:
`registered`, `registrar_confirmed_available`, or `premium_or_reserved`. A
provisional name is never terminal. Identify the strongest survivor when one
exists. Otherwise follow the step 6 transition that matches the current state.

### 8. Recommend

For a generation route, return exactly three finalists unless the user asks for
more; when a **Generation shortfall** ended the funnel, return every survivor and
report the shortfall instead of inventing replacements. For a verification-only
shortlist, rank the registrar-confirmed survivors without inventing names to fill
a quota. For each returned name, include:

- spelling and pronunciation;
- why it fits and its strongest downside;
- brand score out of 70;
- registrar-confirmed domain evidence and prices.

For generation, alternatives, remix, and refinement routes, also include the atom
recipe, lens or user provenance, and two nearby remix directions. Verification-only
results omit those generation artifacts.

Name a winner when at least one name survives. When at least two survive, also
name a runner-up and state the deciding trade-off in one sentence. When none
survive, report the shortfall without recommending a name. Keep user preference
separate from the numeric brand score. Warn that the workflow did not perform
trademark clearance, social-handle verification, or legal review.

Save a durable report only when the user asks for one; follow
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/durable-report.md`.

## Completion gate

Stop only at a terminal state: step 7's **Complete when**, or a step 6
**Generation shortfall**, **Evidence blocked**, or **Input blocked**. Every domain
actually queried is accounted for by status.

A generated `unknown` or `invalid_candidate` that was recorded and excluded does
not block completion. An `unknown` returns **Evidence blocked** only when it
belongs to a supplied shortlist or prevents the domain gate, and an
`invalid_candidate` returns **Input blocked** only for a supplied name.

The user's choice and step 7's pre-action recheck close the run. Only a separately
authorized, successful registration could establish acquisition, and this skill
never claims it.
